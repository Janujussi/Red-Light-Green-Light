# Red-Light-Green-Light

### This is a recreation of "Red Light, Green Light" from Netflix's hit show "Squid Game."

### The game was developed on an Arduino in C++.

#### main.cpp is located in "src".
#### "SegmentDisplay" contains the class I created for segment displays for this project.
###### P.S. Comment formatting translated to GitHub weirdly.
